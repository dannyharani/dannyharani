# Hey!
## I'm Danny, here are some things about me
I'm a software engineering student at the University of Ottawa.<br>
I have a passion for programming and football (*soccer*).<br>
When I'm not studying, programming or playing football, I can be found taking photos with a film camera or doing some simulated driving on F1 22.
